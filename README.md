# Frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

## About the project

This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. As a student I was provided visual assets and a game loop engine. My goal was to edit js files using object-oriented functions.

## How to run the game 

Use this link to play the game: [Play](https://singail.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) 

## How to play

The game consists of 1 player, several enemies and blocks of grass, stone and water. At the beggining of the game, a player is standing on the grass and enemies are moving through the stone area at a different speed. The goal of a player is to reach the water without colliding into any of enemies. 

If a player collides into enemy, it moves back to the start position and has 0 points. A player has 3 lives (3 stars). The game is lost if a player collides with enemy 7 times.

When a player gets to the water, he scores 1 point. The game is won when a player scores 6 points.
